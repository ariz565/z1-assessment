# Assessment: Movie Search App

## Introduction

This project was completed as part of a coding assessment to demonstrate proficiency in API integration, UI development, and asynchronous programming. The challenge was to create a functional web app within approximately one hour using a public API.

## Project Choice: Movie Search App using OMDb API

After evaluating the assessment options, I chose to build the **Movie Search App** because it offers a good balance of technical challenges and engaging user experience. The application allows users to search for movies, view search results, and access detailed information about each film.

## Assessment Requirements Fulfilled

According to the assessment guidelines, the Movie Search App implements the following required features:

1. ✅ **Search Interface**: Users can search for movies by title
2. ✅ **API Integration**: Successfully fetches and handles data from the OMDb API
3. ✅ **Results Display**: Shows movie results in a responsive grid with poster, title, and year
4. ✅ **Detail View**: Clicking a movie reveals comprehensive information (plot, actors, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionality

- **API Integration**: The app connects to the OMDb API with proper error handling
- **Component State Management**: Implements React state for search terms and results
- **JSON Data Parsing**: Efficiently processes and displays API response data

### Advanced Features

Beyond the core requirements, I added several enhancements:

- **Pagination**: For navigating through large result sets
- **Recent Searches**: History of previous searches with quick access
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme toggle with persistent user preference
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that works on all devices
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback while API requests are in progress
- **Error Handling**: Clear notifications when searches yield no results

## Live Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel, providing a real-world experience for users:

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with Vite for fast development)
- **API Handling**: Axios for HTTP requests
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive design techniques
- **State Management**: React hooks and local state
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to quickly build a functional, user-friendly web application that integrates with external APIs. The implementation focuses on core functionality while including thoughtful enhancements that improve user experience.
